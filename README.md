# ðŸ“‰ Research on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**, **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**, and **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** for dimensionality reduction. The objective is to determine the most effective technique for reducing data dimensionality while preserving its structure and interpretability.

- **Type**: Non-linear.
- **Strengths**:
  - Preserves global and local structures.
  - Faster and more scalable than t-SNE.
  - Flexible for diverse datasets.
- **Limitations**:
  - Sensitive to hyperparameters for some datasets.
